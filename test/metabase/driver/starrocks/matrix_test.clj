  "Compiles the REAL driver namespace against a stub Metabase of each supported shape.

   This is the guard that matters. A single compile-time reference to a var the host does not
   have aborts the whole namespace, so 'did it load at all' is the primary assertion -- and it
   catches references nobody thought to denylist. On unmodified `main` v50/v57 fail on
   `transform-literal-like-pattern-honeysql` and v63 fails on `describe-table-fks`.

   Each shape needs its own JVM: a single JVM can only load `metabase.driver` once. Each shape
   is therefore run exactly once and the result shared across the deftests below."
